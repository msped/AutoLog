# AutoLog 

AutoLog is a parts manager for Car enthusiasts. The site will keep a record of all car parts with the benefit of giving a total price as well as giving other the chance to vote on users builds.

You can view the project here on Heroku: http://autolog-msped.herokuapp.com/

## UX

- A user will want to be able to 'Create a build' to see pricing on future projects.

- A user will wish to read previous 'Builds' that have been created.

- A user will want the functionality to see the total of all the parts added to 'Build'.

- A user will want to update a 'Build' should a link to an external website become inactive or find a different part they wish to buy in the future.

- Each user will wish to only see their own 'Builds' and not other users via a login system.

- Users will wish to delete 'Builds' previously created.
