# AutoLog 

AutoLog is a parts manager for Car enthusiasts. The site will keep a record of all car parts with the benefit of giving a total price as well as giving other the chance to vote on users builds.

You can view the project here on Heroku: http://autolog-msped.herokuapp.com/

## UX

- A user will want to be able to 'Create a build' to see pricing on future projects.

- A user will wish to read previous 'Builds' that have been created.

- A user will want the functionality to see the total of all the parts added to 'Build'.

- A user will want to update a 'Build' should a link to an external website become inactive or find a different part they wish to buy in the future.

- Each user will be able to create builds and either have them public on the builds page for other users to see or keep them private to be seen only on the my builds page.

- Users will wish to delete 'Builds' previously created.

- User would like to be able to share Builds with other users from them to vote on their Builds.

## Deployment

This application was deloyed using Heroku. It can be view here: http://autolog-msped.herokuapp.com/

For this application to be deployed it first requires two files, requirements.txt and a Procfile.

Requirements.txt can be created using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in the command line. The Procfile can be added by typing `echo web: python app.py > Procfile` into the command line.

With both of these file create a new app on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/login). Download the Heroku CLI toolbelt and login to Heroku via the command line. Then in the command line type git init, git add ., git commit, git push heroku master. Finally initalise the app on the Heroku server by typing `heroku ps:scale web=1` and press enter.

Now in the Heroku Settings add the CONFIG VARS IP (0.0.0.0), PORT (5000), MONGO_DBNAME and MONGO_URI.
